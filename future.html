                The Toyota Land Cruiser may have departed the U.S. market (unless you count its Lexus sibling), but it appears that Toyota is looking to bring back its ethos in the form of a small EV crossover. This Compact Cruiser EV concept car revealed during Toyota's presentation about its future EV plans looks like the Land Cruiser's mini-me and appears to capture a similar vibe as the popular Ford Bronco Sport.

                    We don't have any concrete information on the Compact Cruiser's powertrain or platform, but its design speaks wonders. With four doors, a tall and boxy body, short front and rear overhangs, and big fender flares, the Compact Cruiser looks off-road-ready and adventurous. It reminds us of Toyota's boxy FT4X concept from several years ago, but with even more FJ Cruiser–esque retro charm thrown into the mix.
                </p>
    
                <p class="text-description">It's a battery-electric vehicle that will likely ride on one of Toyota's new EV architectures, but we don't know when—or if—it will reach production. Look for more information to come as Toyota continues to flesh out its EV product plan within the next year or so.
